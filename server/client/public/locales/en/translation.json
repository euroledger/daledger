            "description1": "Much like Greek interiors, Mediterranean design is influenced by location. Touches of Spain, Greece and Italy can be found in Mediterranean homes, and these locations are brought to life through bright, bold colors influenced by the sea and sky, like turquoise, emerald and yellow. Decorative mosaic tile is often used on interior elements like floors, tabletops, bullnose edged counters, mirrors and backsplashes to bring a charming rustic appeal to the home. Mediterranean furniture is built short and low to the ground. The feet on the furniture are turned and ornately detailed. The outdoors is always embraced, and many homes blur the line between inside and outside using picture windows and glass sliding doors. Red tiled rooftops, similar to Tuscan architecture, adorn many Mediterranean homes. Wrought iron banisters and balconies are also popular features (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019)",
            "title2": "Traditional", 
            "description2": "A traditional home will be filled with furniture from various period styles such as Tudor, Regence, Louis XV and Georgian. However, unlike eclectic interiors, traditionally styled homes have a much more distinct visual cohesiveness in color palette and materials. Tables, chairs and sofas are typically made from dark woods and are ornately detailed with carvings and curvatures. Windows are similarly designed with scalloped edges, fringe accents and luxurious drapes gathered together with tasseled cords. Fabrics feature a variety of different patterns including damask, florals, stripes and plaids. Colors are muted and subdued to create a calm ambiance throughout the home. Rooms are lit up with shimmering crystal chandeliers and silver candlesticks offering a warm flickering glow. Fresh or silk flowers in detailed vases and still-life oil paintings are often used as decorative accessories (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title3": "Urban", 
            "description3": "Urban, or Soft Industrial, interiors share a similar sleekness to loft-like homes with a bit of rustic flair tossed in. Exposed brick and stone gives walls character, and industrial pendant lighting made of steel, copper and wrought iron illuminate all of the vintage details throughout the home. Lighting is also an important element because it breaks up the deep dark hues that dress the floors, walls and furniture. Floor to ceiling windows, used to keep things light, are another classic characteristic of this city style. Furniture is made up of a mix of weathered and glossy woods to create a perfect balance of old world style and industrial style (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019)",

            "description4": "Contemporary style is often interchanged with modern design – however, there are a few differences. Unlike its modern counterpart, contemporary style borrows from various time periods, creating an eclectic environment. For instance, sleek, simple furniture and art can be combined with detailed molding around walls and windows. Contemporary style also takes a note from minimal home design, as layouts are open and airy with no clutter in sight. Furnishings have sharp, 90-degree angles and are upholstered with simple fabrics such as wool, cotton and linen that have no ornamentation or patterns. Instead, sofas, chairs and stools are covered in neutral colors like black, white and tan. No fringe, skirts, trim or tassels can be found on contemporary furniture, as all legs are exposed. Light fixtures are made up of sleek materials like glass, ceramic, polished nickel or stainless steel (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title5": "Minimalist", 
            "description5": "Minimalist homes are free of any clutter, only displaying items like couches, tables and light fixtures that are essential for functional living. Minimalist interiors have a focus on simplicity and effortless beauty. Character is brought forth not through detail, but through natural materials and essential items. Rooms are monochromatic, usually featuring subdued neutrals. Walls are kept simple with only one or two decorative pieces, like a canvas or a mirror. All surfaces, from the kitchen to the bathroom should be completely cleared off. Furniture features clean lines with very little detail, and they often double as storage, like ottomans that open up to reveal space. Architectural minimalism is influenced by Japanese Zen philosophy and the aesthetic principles of Ma and Wabi-sabi, which appreciate the value of empty space and absence of ornamentation (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title6": "Industrial", 
            "description6": "Industrial interiors give off a cool, modern vibe. The style blends new and repurposed items for a unique combination of modern and vintage. Industrial design is characterized by clean open spaces – every room from the kitchen to the basement contains high, spacious loft-like ceilings. Color palettes are kept cool and subdued – you’ll often see a mix of grays, blacks and whites complemented by pops of blues or greens. Metal is the most often used material in industrial design. It offers a rugged charm and can be used on anything from light fixtures and countertops to stairwells and faucets. Industrial chic decor has become the style of choice for many urban loft spaces that were formerly factories, schools or other old buildings with exposed brick and rafter ceilings (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title7": "Mid Century Modern", 
            "description7": "Mid-century modern interiors can be seen throughout AMC’s hit TV show “Mad Men,” as the design era came to life during the 1940s-70s. Mid-century modern homes have a seamless flow from the inside to the outside thanks to sliding doors, picture windows, skylights and patios. Windows are often left bare to emphasize outdoor views. The furniture in is entirely unique, featuring statement pieces like marshmallow sofas and egg chairs. Many pieces, such as the Noguchi table, are asymmetrical and feature amorphous components, which make them feel more like sculptures than pieces of furniture [Attfield 1997]. Elements like floors and ceiling beams are stripped down to their original form, while walls are dressed up with graphic wallpaper featuring bold geometric patterns (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title8": "Bohemian", 
            "description8": "Bohemian-style homes are equipped with a laid-back atmosphere and place an emphasis on nature, intricate patterns and bright colors like purples, reds and pinks. In fact, all of these elements are frequently combined to create an eclectic and unique aesthetic. Boho chic is all about mixing interesting colors, trinkets, fabrics and various types of furniture without any intention of matching or adhering to a specific style, much like the nomadic vagabonds who inspired it. You might see a contemporary couch featuring striped upholstery alongside a vintage velvet ottoman and a bright-colored statement chair. It’s the mix of different types of furniture that make Bohemian interiors so versatile. Light fixtures are just as unique as the furniture. Intricately detailed pendants, chandeliers dripping with crystals and table lamps complete with fringe are fixtures common for Bohemian homes (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title9": "French Provincial", 
            "description9": "This laid-back style is primarily influenced by the country home in Southern France. French Provincial design is all about creating symmetry and balance in the home. This style can suit both formal and laid-back design tastes, as it combines both elegant and country elements. These homes are generally built out of brick, stone or stucco, and those materials are often found inside the dwellings as well on accent walls and furniture. The more casual French Provincial homes use a color palette of subtle blues, yellows, pinks and whites for a mixture of glamour and whimsy. French Provincial interiors feature French doors, as well as arched windows and entryways adding to the stately elegance of the style. While similar to simple Hamptons style, French Provincial provides subtle ornate details  (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title10": "Colonial British", 
            "description10": "Inspired by the decor prevalent during the colonization of Africa, Asia and the West Indies, British Colonial interiors feature lightweight cotton fabric on drapes, curtains and bedding. The most common color palette includes a mix of whites, beiges and browns to produce a subdued and subtle look. Flowers and plants are consistently used throughout the home to provide a fresh feel. Furniture is made up of materials like wicker, ebony, teak and mahogany. Leather travel trunks with brass latches and rivets were popular items during the heyday of this era. Tables, chairs, cabinets and sofas are usually constructed with dark-colored wood to create a rich, sophisticated ambiance. The deep-colored furniture provides a lovely contrast to the neutral-toned walls. Bell jar lanterns and lighted ceiling fans are popular fixtures to illuminate British Colonial homes. British Colonial decor has a certain casual elegance that makes it a popular choice of interior designers and decorators (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title11": "Eclectic", 
            "description11": "Eclectic home design embraces numerous styles such as modern, vintage and bohemian. A variety of materials and textures are also mixed and matched – you might see a leather sofa combined with a plush rug, a weathered wood table, wrought iron pendants and chrome wall decor. Unlike minimalist styles, eclectic interiors are often filled with various knick-knacks, like vintage dinnerware, modern sculptures, flower vases, etc. Mastering an eclectic home is all about drawing on a number of different textures, colors and styles for a unique environment filled with personality. Despite the variety, this style is not chaotic or haphazard. There are cohesive motifs and themes that tie the disparate pieces together. A common thread such as a recurring neutral tone or shape is often used to subtly connect the varied pieces and create a sense of belonging (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019).",
            "title12": "Shabby Chic", 
            "description12": "Shabby chic presents a balance of rustic and glamorous styles. Its name is credited to London designer Rachel Ashwell who was inspired by treasured “finds” she discovered at flea markets. Furniture of this style appears worn and distressed with painted layers. Fabrics on sofas, bedding and curtains are typically made of cotton and feature white or pastel colors to keep the room looking soft and delicate. Commonly used materials include weathered wood, wrought iron and wicker. Kitchen tables are constructed out of warm lumber and feature a textured area rug underneath. Tables are set with vintage teacups and linen napkins and vintage chandeliers light up the room. Overall, a beachy, airy ambiance can be found throughout shabby chic interiors. The wear-and-tear look is similar to French Country and Cottage style decor (Decor Interiors, Style Glossary, September 2019)."

            "description2": "Simple and rustic, yet colorful and quite functional, southwest landscape design is an intriguing, low maintenance garden style that is growing in popularity.

            "title10": "Italian", 
            "description10": "Italian gardens are as rich and diverse as cuisine in the Mediterranean region.
